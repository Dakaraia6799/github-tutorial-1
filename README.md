## Git vs. GitHub
 Git is a version control software that takes "snapshots" of a programmers code  
 and keeps track of changes and modifications that have been made to the project   
 itself, while Github is a website where a programmer can send code to the cloud  
 so that the code itself lives elsewhere instead of locally. Github is also at the enter  
 of social coding, where a pethora of programmers can use eachothers' code as a  
 starting point to start their own project.
